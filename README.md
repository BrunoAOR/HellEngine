# HellEngine
HellEngine is a 3D Game Engine built as a group project within the context of a Master's degree in Game Desgin and Development. It was built with the intent of learning how to structure a project as big as a Game Engine and also learn the basics around graphics programming with OpenGL using the programmable pipeline.
